this was a bit of everything learnt along the way chained together, and finally
an explanation of what a stack pivot is.

first off...a stack pivot is when you are able to run a rop gadget but don't have many
bytes, so you 'pivot' the stack to get more room. basically you find a pointer and jump to
where you have control and jump to there.

this video explains it well.

basically you can get the offset from ghidra for a pointer or a function
you need to find some of the hex numbers for got, plt, etc using the command line
use the following command to check version of libc being used

ldd pwnshop

and then use this to search

strings -a -t x <location of libc> | grep "/bin/sh"      (for example)

use https://libc.blukat.me/ to search for which libc the remote server may be
using.
